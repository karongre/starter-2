            </div>

            <p>I was born and raised in Saint Thomas Nestled in the shimmering turquoise waters of the Caribbean Sea,
                Saint Thomas, one of the idyllic U.S. Virgin Islands, stands as a testament to the beauty and
                tranquility that nature can craft. A jewel of the American territories, Saint Thomas is renowned for its
                pristine beaches, lush green hills, and a vibrant blend of cultures. I am proud to have grown up in such
                a beautiful place. </p>

            <h4> A Tapestry of Natural Beauty </h4>
            <p>A significant portion of Saint Thomas' allure lies in its breath-taking natural beauty. The island is a
                picturesque montage of rolling hills carpeted with lush greenery, offering stunning vistas of the
                surrounding sea. Its coastline is adorned with powdery white sand beaches like Magens Bay, famed for its
                calm waters and untouched sands, providing a serene backdrop for both locals and visitors seeking solace
                in the embrace of nature. The crystal-clear waters beckon snorkeling enthusiasts to explore the vibrant
                underwater life at Coki Point, where coral reefs teem with a kaleidoscope of marine flora and fauna.</p>
            <p>Positioned as the bustling nexus of the New South, Atlanta, Georgia, seamlessly marries its rich history
                with a dynamic modernity, making it a hub for culture, business, and remarkable urban growth. Famed for
                its lush canopy, the city earns its nickname as the "City in a Forest," providing an immersive backdrop
                of verdant beauty amidst a skyline that's ever reaching upward.</p>

            <p> I lived in Atlanta, GA for five years after undergrad. Atlanta is vibrant city that is a beacon of
                culture and fun!
            <h4> A Beacon of History and Civil Rights </h4>
            <p>Atlanta’s historical narrative is as rich as it is significant. Home to pivotal civil rights movements,
                the city echoes the voices of legendary figures like Martin Luther King Jr., whose legacy is enshrined
                at the National Historical Park. Visitors can walk through the iconic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where
                King once preached messages of love, justice, and equality. The Center for Civil and Human Rights
                further highlights Atlanta's significant role in the fight for civil rights, offering a poignant tribute
                and deep insights into the American civil rights movement. Atlanta’s historical narrative is as rich as

            </div>
            <p>Miami has to be my favorite travel spot in the world! It's the best place to travel as a young adult
                who's looking for a quick weekend getaway. Nestled on the southeastern tip of Florida, Miami is often
                referred to as "The Magic City" because of its rapid growth from a small settlement to a booming
                metropolitan area. Renowned for its dazzling beaches, thriving arts scene, and pulsating nightlife,
                Miami is a melting pot of cultures, primarily influenced by Latin American and Caribbean immigrants,
                which has given the city its unique flavor. </p>

            <h4> Four Seasons Hotel Miami : An Oasis of Luxury and Comfort</h4>

            <p> Perched amidst the bustling heart of Miami, the Four Seasons Hotel Miami stands as a beacon of luxury,
                elegance, and tranquillity. Located in the vibrant Brickell neighborhood, it perfectly encapsulates the
                glamorous lifestyle synonymous with Miami. </p>

            <h4> Architectural Excellence </h4>
            <p>Standing tall at 70 stories, the Four Seasons Hotel Miami boasts of being one of the tallest buildings in
                the city. Its sleek architecture, characterized by modern lines and glass facades, beautifully mirrors
                the azure waters of the nearby Biscayne Bay. The interiors are equally captivating, offering a tasteful
                blend of contemporary luxury with subtle nods to Miami’s vibrant culture.</p>

            </div>
            <p> I visited the country of Israel this past May for the global immersion program through the Ross Business
                School. The program was focused on technology and enterpreneurship in the context of the startup economy
                that exists in Israel. </p>

            <h4>Jerusalem: A City of Sacred Echoes</h4>
            <p> Jerusalem, the capital city of Israel, is a place where time seems to resonate with echoes of ancient
                civilizations. Known as the spiritual home to the three major Abrahamic religions - Judaism,
                Christianity, and Islam - Jerusalem houses sacred sites like the Western Wall, the Church of the Holy
                Sepulchre, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque, making it a significant pilgrimage site for people from around the
                world.</p>

            <h4> Tel Aviv: The Pulse of Modern Israel </h4>
            <p> In stark contrast, Tel Aviv, often termed as the 'Non-Stop City', pulses with youthful energy,
                innovation, and modernity. As the economic and technological hub of Israel, Tel Aviv is home to soaring
                skyscrapers, thriving businesses, and a vibrant nightlife. The city prides itself on its beautiful
                beaches along the Mediterranean, where locals and tourists alike can enjoy the sun, sea, and sand amidst
                the backdrop of a bustling urban landscape.</p>

            </div>
            <p> Last summer, I had the opportunity to visit Vancouver while living in Seattle, WA for the summer. I had
                a great experience and thought that Vancouver has some similiar traits to Miami, FL in the look and feel
                of the city.</p>
            <p>Nestled between the rugged Coast Mountain range and the expansive Pacific Ocean, Vancouver, a bustling
                west coast seaport in British Columbia, is often hailed as one of the most beautiful cities in the
                world. This cosmopolitan city offers a harmonious blend of natural beauty and urban sophistication,
                providing an unparalleled quality of life to its residents and a memorable experience for visitors.</p>
